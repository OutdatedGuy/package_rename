#### Running Package Rename

Execute the command as per your config location:

if config file exists in either pubspec.yaml or root path:

```bash
dart run package_rename
```

OR

if config file exists in a custom folder:

```bash
dart run package_rename --path="path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

or

```bash
dart run package_rename -p "path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

## Flavour Support

Package Rename supports flavours. You can add flavour specific configurations by adding `flavour_name` in configuration key.

```yaml
package_rename_config-flavour_name:
  # ...
```

> For full example click [here](example/example.md#flavour-configuration)

And then run the following command:

```bash
dart run package_rename --flavour=flavour_name
```

or

```bash
dart run package_rename -f flavour_name
```

With custom config file location:

```bash
dart run package_rename --flavour=flavour_name --path="path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

## And that's it! ðŸŽ‰

Now you can deploy your production ready app to change the _WORLD!_
