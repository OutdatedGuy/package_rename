Package Rename handles changing **_33 fields_** across **_17 files_** on **_6 platforms_** so you can focus on your awesome project.

For more info see [list of changed fields](CHANGED_FIELDS.md)

## Getting started

#### Add to Dependencies

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  package_rename: ^1.5.3
```

#### Create configuration

You can create configurations by adding `package_rename_config` key in:

1. Root `pubspec.yaml` file
1. `package_rename_config.yaml` file at root of your project or a custom folder in the project

## Usage

#### Running Package Rename

Execute the command as per your config location:

if config file exists in either pubspec.yaml or root path:

```bash
dart run package_rename
```

OR

if config file exists in a custom folder:

```bash
dart run package_rename --path="path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

or

```bash
dart run package_rename -p "path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

## Flavour Support

Package Rename supports flavours. You can add flavour specific configurations by adding `flavour_name` in configuration key.

```yaml
package_rename_config-flavour_name:
  # ...
```

> For full example click [here](example/example.md#flavour-configuration)

And then run the following command:

```bash
dart run package_rename --flavour=flavour_name
```

or

```bash
dart run package_rename -f flavour_name
```

With custom config file location:

```bash
dart run package_rename --flavour=flavour_name --path="path/to/package_rename_config.yaml"
```

## Known Issues

### iOS and macOS issues with `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`:

The `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`'s in **ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj** and **macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj** have different values for different targets. Like, in my case:

**DEFAULT**

- `rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample`
- `rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample.RunnerTests`

**EXTENSIONS**

- `rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample.Share-Extension`
- `rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample.NotificationServiceExtension`
- blah blah blah...

Hence, to properly change the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` without removing the **Extension** name, make sure all `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`'s except the **DEFAULT** ones are enclosed in double quotes (`""`).

```diff
- PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample.Share-Extension;
+ PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = "rocks.outdatedguy.packageRenameExample.Share-Extension";
```

## And that's it! üéâ

Now you can deploy your production ready app to change the _WORLD!_
